## Professional Experience

### Modeling Quant Analyst Intern, Risk Analysis, Southern Company (Atlanta, GA) <br/> <span style="text-align:right;">May 2017-Aug 2017</span>
#### Dynamic Tenor Recommendation Project (Matlab, Bloomberg Terminal, Excel, and VBA)
* Designed a routine to compute multi-year (20/30/40 years) optimal pricing strategies of fixed income instruments using CIR interest rate model and term structure modeling techniques.
* Managed all phases of fixed income project work from building top-down valuation with self-documenting Matlab code, Bloomberg Terminal, Excel and VBA to completion. Analyzed different portfolios along various risk metrics such as IRR, Sharpe Ratio, and P95 tail risk.
* Calibrated model, implemented model validation including VaR and benchmark testing. Act as a liaison between Risk Modeling, Treasury, and company executives to recommend bond issuance in accordance with analytical output and risk tolerance.
* Achieved 10% savings and 16% risk reduction for subsidiaries with the new optimal pricing strategies that lowered interest rates. Closed over $640 million in monthly bond financing.
